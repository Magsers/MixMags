Brief description of the animation achieved : 
*This is a DJ station.  

*When you load the sketch two input boxes appear and ask you to input two tunes you would like to play.   
When you hover the mouse over each deck, instructions appear which tell you to left click to load and right click to unload the deck.  When you load the deck the tune you 
inputted appears and when you right click it deselects the record and the tune also disappears.  This happens on both sides.  

*There is a mixer in the middle with square buttons
and circular controld.  The square buttons activate when you left click and deactivate when you right click. The circular controls are not interactive but when you hover over 
them a dialog box appears asking if you need further instructions.  This only happens once.  You can slide the Crossfader left or right which is the rectangular, blue knob 
at the bottom.  

*If you hover the mouse over either of the speakers they give the visual effect of music pumping from them.  

*The  background changes colour in order to give the effect of a disco/party going on in the background.  

Known bugs/problems : 

The Crossfader slider at the bottom centre of the screen I would have liked when I drag it with the mouse that it would stay in position but I could not figure out how to 
do this.  

I was trying to switch on the CUE, SYNC and PLAY buttons individually but I couldn't get that to work so they all activate instead.  

I also wanted the records to give the illusion of spinning.  I tried to do this a few times by drawing a line from the centre of the record to it's 
circumference and have this change position pixel by pixel but it just wouldn't even move so I settled by just letting it load and unload.

Sources : I just used the lecture material for this.
